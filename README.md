Just made for fun, some stuff might be broken.

1. If it doesn't build the native modules automatically with `npm install` run `node-gyp rebuild`
2. Set tablets area/config in `configs/mmConfigs.json`, optionally run `node utils/converters.js` to convert from/to mm values, see comments in `utils/converters.js` for examples.
