Node console app for tablet input. Just made for fun, some stuff might be broken.

1. Install with `npm install`
2. If it doesn't build the native modules automatically run `node-gyp rebuild`
3. Set tablets area in `configs/configs.json`, modify values in `utils/Converter.js` and run it with node to convert from/to mm values.
4. Run with `node app.js` or `npm start`
